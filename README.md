# Tania 8

## A Drupal 8 theme supporting bi-directional styles

You can have different files for RTL and LTR languages.

## Getting Started
This package requires GruntJS, NodeJS, NPM 

First of all go to your drupal 8 project directory and clone this theme there:

```shell
cd [project-directory]/themes/
```

And then


```shell
git clone https://github.com/amirhossein693/tania8.git 
```

After that, you need to run this command to install node modules:

```shell
npm install 
```

And then run this command to install the frontend packages like bootstrap

```shell
bower install 
```

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may setup the package with this command:

```shell
grunt build
```

Enjoy it.

Also you can use the 'serve' task for Developing mode.

```shell
grunt serve
```
